# Multiprocessing in python

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to Parallel Programming in Python, focusing on multi-threading and multiprocessing techniques. Please feel free to use the code from  this repo for your applications.

### Contents:
1. Parallel Programming in Python
2. Multi-threading (shared memory parallelism)
3. Multiprocessing (Distributed-memory parallelism)
    * Process Class
    * Pool Class
        * Synchronous calls
            * pool.Apply()
            * pool.Map()
            * pool.Starmap()
        * Asynchronous calls
            * pool.Apply_async()
            * pool.Map_async()
            * pool.Starmap_async()
            * pool.imap()
            * pool.imap_unordered()
    * Process-to-Process communication
        * Pipes


All the theory and collection of code is documented on the notebook __```Multiprocessing.ipynb```__.
However, individual python files for each of the subsection too, incase you just want to go through code for only that topic.
